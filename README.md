# WelcomeWeekDirectionApp
Location/Direction app created during the McMaster DeltaHacks IV Hackathon.

This app was created during the McMaster DeltaHacks IV Hackathon to help first year McMaster students during welcome week navigate around the campus. 

To use the app, pick from one of the four buildings on campus. The latitude and longitude for that building will be displayed as well as the users current location via latitude and longitude. The lat and long of the user will constantly change as the user moves around and with a little bit of geographical knowledge, the user can find their way to the building.

Although the app was not as finished as hoped, it was still an incredible learning experience in terms of using Google Location Services.


Note: This app was originally supposed to work with AR technology to provide in real life directions via arrows on the ground. The AR components were not able to be successfully integrated into this version but it was still fun to experiment.
