# WelcomeWeekDirectionApp
Location/Direction app created during the McMaster DeltaHacks IV Hackathon.

This app was created during the McMaster DeltaHacks IV Hackathon to help first year McMaster students during welcome week navigate around 
the campus. 

This app was originally supposed to work with AR technology to provide in real life directions via arrows on the ground. The AR components
was not able to be successfully integrated into this version but it was still fun to experiment.
